Script to display mountain weather forecasts for multiple peaks in a single window using mountain-forecast.com data.

The photo above is from a 2020 ski touring trip I took to Garibaldi lake just north of Vancouver. Before heading out to destinations like this, I often use the website mountain-forecast.com to check where the best weather will be. This can involve a lot of clicking around between pages associated with each peak. I made this script so I can quickly see information for prominent peaks in my area in a single screen.
